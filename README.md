# React FAQs

## 1. Is JSX mandatory for React?
- **Answer:** No, JSX is not mandatory, but it is a recommended syntax extension for describing UI components in a more readable way.

## 2. Is ES6 mandatory for React?
- **Answer:** No, ES6 is not mandatory, but it is commonly used and recommended for its enhanced features like arrow functions, classes, and destructuring.

## 3. {TitleComponent} vs {<TitleComponent/>} vs {<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>} in JSX:
- **Answer:**
  - `{TitleComponent}`: Represents a reference to a component, not rendering it.
  - `{<TitleComponent/>}`: Renders the `TitleComponent` using a self-closing tag.
  - `{<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>}`: Also renders the `TitleComponent` using an opening and closing tag. The self-closing tag is equivalent in JSX.

## 4. How can I write comments in JSX?
- **Answer:** Use curly braces for inline comments, and for multi-line comments, wrap them in curly braces and use the JavaScript-style comment syntax.

## 5. What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>`?
- **Answer:** Both are used for rendering multiple elements without introducing an extra parent div. `<React.Fragment>` is the older syntax, and `<></>` is the shorthand introduced in React 16.

## 6. What is Virtual DOM?
- **Answer:** Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM that React uses to efficiently update and render components by minimizing direct manipulations to the real DOM.

## 7. What is Reconciliation in React?
- **Answer:** Reconciliation is the process of updating the real DOM to match the Virtual DOM efficiently, optimizing the rendering of components.

## 8. What is React Fiber?
- **Answer:** React Fiber is a reimplementation of the React core algorithm designed to improve the responsiveness and rendering of components, enabling better handling of asynchronous updates.

## 9. Why do we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
- **Answer:** Keys are used to give React a stable identity to each component during updates, aiding in efficient rendering and maintaining component state. Keys are needed when rendering dynamic lists of components.

## 10. Can we use index as keys in React?
- **Answer:** While it is possible, it is not recommended, especially when the list is dynamic and items can be added or removed. Using unique identifiers as keys is a better practice.

## 11. What is props in React? Ways to pass props.
- **Answer:** `props` are properties that allow passing data from parent to child components. Props can be passed directly in JSX or through component attributes.

## 12. What is a Config Driven UI?
- **Answer:** Config Driven UI is an approach where UI components' behavior and appearance are configured through external data or settings, making the UI more flexible and configurable.

 # JavaScript Module Exports

## 1. Named Export:
- **Syntax:** `export const myVariable = ...;` or `export function myFunction() { ... }`
- **Usage:** Imported using curly braces, e.g., `import { myVariable } from './module';`
- **Notes:** Allows exporting multiple variables or functions from a module.

## 2. Default Export:
- **Syntax:** `export default myDefault;`
- **Usage:** Imported without curly braces, e.g., `import myDefault from './module';`
- **Notes:** Allows exporting a single "default" value from a module.

## 3. `* as` Export:
- **Syntax:** `export * as myExports from './module';`
- **Usage:** Imported using an alias, e.g., `import { myExports } from './module';`
- **Notes:** Imports all exports from a module under a single alias.

# Importance of `config.js` File

- **Role:** The `config.js` file is commonly used to store configuration settings such as API keys, environment variables, or any values that might change between development and production.
- **Benefits:** Centralizing configuration settings makes it easier to manage, update, and ensure consistency across the application.

# React Hooks

## 1. What are React Hooks?
- **Definition:** React Hooks are functions provided by React that allow functional components to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features that were previously only available in class components.
- **Purpose:** Facilitates state management and side effects in functional components, promoting code reuse and composability.

## 2. Importance of `useState` Hook:
- **Purpose:** The `useState` Hook is used in functional components to add local state to the component. It enables components to manage and update state without using class components.
- **Benefits:** Simplifies state management, enhances readability, and avoids the need for class components when using state in React applications.

 # Technical Concepts FAQ

## 1. What is a Microservice?
- **Definition:** Microservices are small, independent, and loosely coupled services that work together to form a complete application.

## 2. What is Monolith architecture?
- **Definition:** Monolith architecture is a single-tiered software application where the user interface and data management functions are combined into a single program from a single platform.

## 3. What is the difference between Monolith and Microservice?
- **Difference:**
  - **Monolith:** Single-tiered, tightly coupled components.
  - **Microservice:** Decentralized, independent, and loosely coupled components.

## 4. Why do we need a useEffect Hook?
- **Purpose:** `useEffect` is used in React to perform side effects in functional components. It's commonly used for data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM.

## 5. What is Optional Chaining?
- **Definition:** Optional Chaining is a JavaScript feature that enables reading the value of a property located deep within a chain of connected objects without having to explicitly validate that each reference in the chain is valid.

## 6. What is Shimmer UI?
- **Definition:** Shimmer UI is a user interface design technique that uses subtle animations or placeholder elements to indicate that content is loading, providing a better user experience during data retrieval.

## 7. What is the difference between JS expression and JS statement?
- **Difference:**
  - **Expression:** Produces a value. e.g., `3 + 4` or `myFunction()`.
  - **Statement:** Performs an action. e.g., `if (x > 5) { /* do something */ }`.

## 8. What is Conditional Rendering, explain with a code example?
- **Explanation:** Conditional Rendering is displaying different components or content based on certain conditions. Example in React:
  ```jsx
  {isLoggedIn ? <UserProfile /> : <Login />}

## 9. What is CORS?
- **Definition:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by web browsers that controls how web pages in one domain can request and interact with resources in another domain.

## 10. What is async and await?
- **Definition:** `async` is a keyword used to declare a function as asynchronous. `await` is used inside an asynchronous function to pause execution until a Promise is settled.

## 11. What is the use of `const json = await data.json();` in `getRestaurants()`?
- **Explanation:** It fetches data from an API using the `fetch` function, converts the response to JSON format, and assigns it to the `json` constant, allowing easy manipulation of the data in subsequent code.

# Adding Images to Your App

## Using HTML `<img>` Tag


```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
```

## Using CSS background

```html
.element {
  background-image: url('image.jpg');
}
```

## Using react
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import image from './image.jpg';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={image} alt="Description" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```


## `console.log(useState())`

If you `console.log(useState())`, it will log an array with two elements: the current state value and the updater function. For example:

```javascript
const [state, setState] = useState();
console.log(useState());
// Output: [undefined, Æ’ dispatchAction()]
```

### `useEffect` without Dependency Array

## `useEffect` without Dependency Array
```
If you don't provide a dependency array to `useEffect`, it will run after every render. This can lead to performance issues and unintended side effects. For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // This will run after every render
  console.log('Effect ran');
});
```


## SPA (Single Page Application)
### SPA (Single Page Application)

SPA is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current page rather than loading entire new pages from the server. This results in a smoother user experience.

## Client Side Routing vs Server Side Routing

### Client Side Routing

Client-side routing is handled by the browser, and navigation occurs without a full page refresh. Commonly used in SPAs.

```javascript
// Example with React Router
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/page1" component={Page1} />
        <Route path="/page2" component={Page2} />
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```
### Server Side Routing

Server-side routing involves the server responding to each request with a new HTML page. A full page reload occurs with each navigation.

```javascript
// Example with Express
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/page1', (req, res) => {
  // Render HTML for Page 1
});

app.get('/page2', (req, res) => {
  // Render HTML for Page 2
});
```

## Nested Routes with react-router-dom

To create nested routes using `react-router-dom`, follow these steps:

1. **Install `react-router-dom`:**
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
    ```
Set up Main App Component:

```jsx
// App.js
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './Home';
import About from './About';
import Dashboard from './Dashboard';

const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Switch>
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
      <Route path="/" component={Home} />
    </Switch>
  </Router>
);

export default App;
```
Create Nested Routes:

Inside components like Dashboard, use additional Route components.
Example in Dashboard.js:
```jsx
// Dashboard.js
import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Overview from './Overview';
import Settings from './Settings';

const Dashboard = ({ match }) => (
  <div>
    <h2>Dashboard</h2>
    <Route path={`${match.path}/overview`} component={Overview} />
    <Route path={`${match.path}/settings`} component={Settings} />
  </div>
);

export default Dashboard;
```

Adjust Links for Nested Routes:

In components or navigation, use Link components with correct paths.
Example in Dashboard component:
```jsx
// Dashboard.js
import { Link } from 'react-router-dom';

const Dashboard = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>Dashboard</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><Link to="/dashboard/overview">Overview</Link></li>
      <li><Link to="/dashboard/settings">Settings</Link></li>
    </ul>
  </div>
);

export default Dashboard;
```

# React Router Dom - `createHashRouter` and `createMemoryRouter`

## `createHashRouter`
- Used for client-side routing with hash fragments in the URL.
- Ideal for static websites or environments without server-side configuration.
- Example usage:
  ```jsx
  import { createHashHistory } from 'history';
  import { createHashRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

  const history = createHashHistory();
  const App = () => <createHashRouter history={history}>...</createHashRouter>;
  ```
## `createMemoryRouter`
Creates an in-memory history object, useful for testing or non-browser environments.
Doesn't read or write to the address bar.
Example usage:
```jsx
import { createMemoryHistory } from 'history';
import { createMemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';

const history = createMemoryHistory();
const App = () => <createMemoryRouter history={history}>...</createMemoryRouter>;
```

## Class Based Components - Lifecycle Methods

 Order of lifecycle method calls:
   - `constructor`
   - `render`
   - `componentDidMount`
   - `shouldComponentUpdate`
   - `render`
   - `componentDidUpdate`
   - `componentWillUnmount`

## Why use `componentDidMount`:
   - Executes after the component is inserted into the DOM.
   - Used for initial setup, data fetching, and side effects.

## Why use `componentWillUnmount`:
   - Executes before the component is removed from the DOM.
   - Used for cleanup, like cancelling network requests or clearing timers.

## Why use `super(props)` in constructor:
   - `super(props)` is used to call the constructor of the parent class (React.Component).
   - Necessary to access `this.props` in the constructor.

## Why can't the `useEffect` callback function be async:
   - `useEffect` expects a cleanup function or undefined to be returned.
   - Async functions always return a promise, causing issues with cleanup.
